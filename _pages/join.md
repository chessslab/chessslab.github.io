# CHESSLab@CISPA: PhD in Human-Centred and Organizational Security (Fully Funded For 4+ Years)

CISPA is one of the __best places in Germany, Europe, and the world to pursue a PhD__ in cybersecurity. This is because we have an extensive, __international, young, and open community of cybersecurity researchers__ you can find nowhere else. CISPA has an expert in everything regarding cybersecurity and AI. While you will be a member of the CHESS lab and supervised by [Jonas](/team/), you will be naturally integrated into the wider CISPA family, creating opportunities to do joint projects with PhD researchers from other teams.

[<span style="color:red">__Please use the official CISPA application portal to hand in your application (Link).__</span>](https://jobs.cispa.saarland/de_DE/jobs)

## Our Research
Our research is within the fields of __Human-Centred Security__, __Organizational Cybersecurity__, and __Industrial Control System Security__. In our team, we address cybersecurity challenges that organizations and humans face. We want to understand how theoretical and academic cybersecurity ideas are implemented in organizations' practice. We are also interested in understanding the economic incentives behind security decisions and general principles of Human-Centred Security and Usable Security. 

We go into organizations, engage with decision-makers and users, and test interventions to improve organizations' cyberresilience. In our studies, __we combine methods like interviews, diary studies, questionnaires, field observations, qualitative coding, web crawling, data analysis with LLM, statistical tests, and prototype coding__. In summary, our work is highly interdisciplinary.

In previous work, we have, for example, worked with Chief Information Security Officers in various workshops, investigated the hidden costs of phishing simulations in a large organization, and crawled the websites of security awareness vendors to understand their promises to their customers.  

## What We Offer
* A fully-funded PhD position, with a gross __salary starting at approx. 58,000‚Ç¨/year__, [following the federal TV√∂D 13 statute](https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tvoed/bund?id=tvoed-bund&g=E_13&s=1&zv=VBL&z=100&zulage=&stkl=1&r=&zkf=&kk=17%2C05%25), with regular increase.

* You will work as a researcher at the world's no. 1 cybersecurity institute, together with hundreds of other researchers from around the world.
* Retreats, team events, extensive onboarding, special trainings for presentation, writing, method, and leadership skills and regular CISPA-wide social events create a __wonderful working experience__.

## Your PhD Journey
* __You will be a researcher!__ Most of your time, you will develop, test, execute, and present research projects. We will create the projects together, based on your interests and strengths.
* We have established connections to various world-leading international universities, e.g., in the US, the UK, the Netherlands, or Singapore. This allows for __international research visits during your PhD__.  
* You will gather __your first leadership experience__ in co-supervising Bachelor's and Master's students in their thesis projects and student assistants (HiWis) in their projects.
* You __won‚Äôt have teaching obligations__ (unless you want to), which is a major advantage as you can focus on your research.
* As we are a rather young lab, your knowledge and opinion will __shape how and what we will work on__.
* We publish our results at international conferences. During your PhD, you will have the opportunity to __travel to multiple conferences around the globe__ (of course, as is typical for cybersecurity, we have all the budget available to finance your travels). Meeting other young, international researchers in different countries may be the most exciting experience during your Ph.D. Journey.
* At CISPA, __we are all equal__: there is no artificial hierarchy between students and faculty, and we use a first-name basis.

* You need to __know the basics of HCI *or* cybersecurity__ through your previous studies.
* We are the world's No. 1 academic cybersecurity research center, and we strive to conduct excellent research. In your application, you must show that you can become an outstanding researcher.

## Formal Criteria
* You must have a __Master's degree__ from a top-tier, research-oriented university in computer science, cybersecurity, electrical engineering, or a related field. 
* If you only have a Bachelor's so far, please check out the website of the [graduate school at Saarland University](https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de/).
* You need to be proficient in written and spoken English. German is not a requirement to work at CISPA.


## MISC
* Saarland is beautiful, the living costs are moderate, and Paris is less than 2 hours away by train. üòâ 
* _Information for international applicants: The freedom of research and teaching is written deep into the German constitution. We live in a time when researchers in other countries are under immense pressure from their governments. However, no one is interfering with our research in Germany and at CISPA. Our team can pursue exactly the type of research we like, which regularly leads to constructive critiques of managers, policy makers, and security vendors, but without the danger of retaliation. ü¶æ_
