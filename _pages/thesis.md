__Work in progress!__


__Thank you for your interest in writing your final thesis with us!__ Theses at our team are in the area of __Human-Centred Security__, __Organizational Cybersecurity__, and __Industrial Control System Security__. The methods our students employ are typicaly interviews, diary studies, questionnaires, field observations, web crawling, statistical tests, and prototype coding. Hence, to write your thesis with us __you need to be willing to engage with human participants__.

We receive multiple requests for thesis supervision per week. A lot of them are genericaly written with GenAI. We will ignore those emails.

If you are interested in a thesis, please contact [Jonas](/team/). Please include the phrase "Security Champions" in your email subject to confirm that you have read this page and understand the implications of theses within our team. We will ignore emails that do not contain this keyword.
