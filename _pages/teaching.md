We ❤️ working with bright minds. 
Our teaching approach is __always highly interactive__. Even in lectures, we seek active participation, feedback, and input. We use tools that enable students to participate and shape a lecture's direction actively. Where our research is empirical, __our teaching style is hands-on, building on our experience from industry and research with practitioners in organizations__. That also means the tasks we hand out are typically based on case studies. We often try to turn differences in students' work experience into an advantage: We team up students already working in the industry with less experienced ones. This __team-building__ allows for skill and knowledge transfer among them.
We also apply new teaching methods, such as combining programming tasks with __LEGO Serious Play__.



# Summer Term 2025
> ## Seminar: [Cybersecurity in Organizational Practice at Saarland University](https://cms.cispa.saarland/orgsec25/)
>In this seminar, we will learn how cybersecurity is practically implemented in organizations (enterprises, public agencies, NGOs, etc.) and discuss why academic cybersecurity concepts are often not followed in practice. We will read and discuss papers on cybersecurity in organizations, frequently utilizing human-centered research methods such as interviews, surveys, focus groups, and case studies. \
> We will read various recent scientific publications on cybersecurity in organizational practice and foundational papers, some of which have been around for over two decades. We will discuss those papers in the seminar based on presentations by student teams. In team assignments, there will be tasks in which the viewpoint of specific organizational stakeholders (e.g., the CEO) has to be taken, and their position towards a cybersecurity strategy must be defended against other stakeholders. Throughout the seminar, we will reflect upon our own (current and future) experience with cybersecurity in organizational practice. We will learn to negotiate cybersecurity strategies with other stakeholders in our future professions. \
